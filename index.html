    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of ground sausage</li>
        <li>1 bulb of garlic, diced</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 brick or bag of frozen chopped spinach</li>

        <li>2 cups of rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>
    <p>Start cooking the rice in a separate pan or rice cooker or whatever. If you&#39;re a rockstar, you&#39;ll add
        half a stick of butter to it because fuck yeah.</p>
    <p>Brown the sausage in a large pan on medium heat. When brown, add the onion and the garlic. When the onions are
        translucent, add the frozen spinach, and the can of cream of mushroom soup. Reduce the heat to medium low, and
        give the spinach some time to thaw. Stir every few minutes, until everything is well mixed and hot.</p>
    <p>Combine apples with other liquid ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Combine flour and other dry ingredients
        after sifting, and roll into a ball. Place the ball in between two sheets of parchment paper and roll flat to
        1/2 inch thickness. Press the flattened dough into a pie plate. Pour liquid filling into dough and bake for 35
        minutes at 375 degrees. </p>
    <p>Serve the spinach mess over the rice. Goes really well with a little soy sauce and sriracha.</p>
